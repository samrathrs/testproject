1.) Which APIs are the correct ones to use for CRUD operations on Dialer (wcb) transaction data (currently stored in RTMC db): 
      - wcb request
      - wcb history
      - wcb request attributes
      - wcb request config
	  

SV : We need objects to store these records.  

http://ace001.dev.broadcloudcc.com:10888/aws/api/auxiliary-data/resources/{type}

We have the following tables to hold WCB transactional data, for this we would need objects to store and retrieve data from Analyer platform.

wcb_request_mst
wcb_request_status_mst (not sure why we needed this)
wcb_request_attributes
wcb_history_mst

We can have all of these objects or can be conslidated. Please verify and decide which one needed.

wcb-request
wcb-history

Here are the sample end points:

http://ace001.dev.broadcloudcc.com:10888/aws/api/auxiliary-data/resources/wcb-request

http://ace001.dev.broadcloudcc.com:10888/aws/api/auxiliary-data/resources/wcb-history

We use the following naming conventions for object attributes. 

String 			: <attr-name>__s
Integer 		: <attr-name>__i
Long 			: <attr-name>__l
Double 			: <attr-name>__d
String Array 	: <attr-name>__sa
Integer Array	: <attr-name>__ia
Long Array		: <attr-name>__la
Double Array	: <attr-name>__da


2.) Can you provide some example parameters for Analyzer's Resource auxiliary data APIs' invocations, especially POST operations?
In particular, which API do I hit to create the object type?
I assume the POST against: 
/api/auxiliary-data/metatdata/{type}



3.) What are the flows of usage?
Do I assume that object type creation (POST) is invoked ONCE for each object type?
Then, subsequent calls should be CRUD operations against: 
/api/auxiliar-data/resources/.....
especially, POST (and sometimes PUT) since Dialer creates new objects for each dialing invocation?!
Dialer's data storage usage consists mostly of data row insertion and then sometimes data row update against the RTMC database
==> Which I assume would translate into object creation and then sometimes object update against the Analyzer APIs?!

4.) Where can I find documentation for the query definition: 
com.tranerainc.tide.pojo.auxiliary.Query
?
